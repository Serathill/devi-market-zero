# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets that are directly served by the web server and do not go through the Vite/React build pipeline.

Files here are accessible from the root of the application URL. For example, a file at `public/favicon.ico` can be accessed at `http://localhost:5173/favicon.ico`.

This is the ideal place for:
- `favicon.ico`
- `robots.txt`
- `manifest.json`
- Other static assets that must retain their original filenames.
